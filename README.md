# Bike-Share-Membership-Analysis
The purpose of this project is to examine the riding habits between Casual riders and Member riders within the month in order to help sell annual memberships to Casual riders. Some of the questions that the data was able to answer: "How long does each group ride on average?" and "Which group ride more frequently?". The data for this project was extracted from an 84775 rows by 17 columns table.
